                        <p class="text-justify">I have been in love with the art of photography most of my life.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">My dad introduced me to photography in the late 80's when he he was training to be a commercial photographer and was acquiring camera and dark room equipment.  I can still remember sitting with him in our darkened kitchen and watching as he developed black and white prints.  From the first moment I saw an image appearing in the developer bath, I was hooked.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">I created mostly black and white images in earlier years because it was more affordable and I didn't have access to a color darkroom.  From loading fresh film into reusable cartridges to developing the negatives to printing the actual images, everything was in my hands.  It was this loss of control when I no longer had access to a darkroom that put my exploration of photography on hold for several years.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">By 2002, the falling price and ever-improving performance of digital cameras combined with my love of technology sparked a renewed interest in photography.  Now I have the creative control I used to have in the black and white darkroom but in color and in a flexible, efficient, and crystal-clear digital format.</p>
