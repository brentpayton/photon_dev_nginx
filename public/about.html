                            <!-- <img src="/images/cropped austin 003.jpg" border="1" width="150" align="left" alt="" hspace="10" title="Brent's Portrait"> -->

                            <p align="justify">I have been in love with the art of photography all of my adult life.  Through photography I explore the overlooked beauty of otherwise mundane objects and reveal new perspectives on classic subjects.</p>

                            <p align="justify">My dad introduced me to photography in the late 80's when he was studying the subject and acquiring camera and dark room equipment.  I can still remember sitting with him in our darkened kitchen and watching as he developed black and white prints.  From the first moment I saw an image appearing in the developer bath, I was hooked.  From that moment, I knew that photography would be a part of my life.</p>

                            <p align="justify">I created mostly black and white images in earlier years because it was more affordable and I didn't have access to or training for a color darkroom.  From loading fresh film into reusable cartridges to developing the negatives to printing the actual images, everything was in my hands.  It was this loss of control when I no longer had access to a darkroom that put my exploration of photography on hold for several years.</p>

                            <p align="justify">By 2002, the falling price and ever-improving performance of digital cameras combined with my love of technology sparked a renewed interest in photography.  Now I have the creative control I used to have in the black and white darkroom but in color and in a flexible, efficient, and crystal-clear digital format.</p>
